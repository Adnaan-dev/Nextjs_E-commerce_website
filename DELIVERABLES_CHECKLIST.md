- ✅ Mentions challenges faced and how they were solved
- ⚠️ Screenshots need to be added by student

### Report Content Includes:

#### File: `PROJECT_REPORT.md` (2 pages)

**Section 1: Project Overview**
- Objectives
- Technology Stack

**Section 2: Rendering Strategy Analysis**
- SSG for Home Page (with rationale)
- ISR for Product Details (with rationale)

## 4. Optional (Bonus) ✅

### Basic Authentication for Admin Dashboard ✅

**Implementation:**
- ✅ API key-based authentication
- ✅ Protected endpoints: POST and PUT
- ✅ Validation via `validateApiKey()` function
- ✅ Key stored in environment variable (`.env.example` provided)
- ✅ API key passed via `x-api-key` header

**Code Location:**
- `lib/db.ts` - `validateApiKey()` function
- `app/api/products/route.ts` - POST endpoint protection
- `app/api/products/update/[id]/route.ts` - PUT endpoint protection
- `app/admin/page.tsx` - Uses API key in requests

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Client sends request with `x-api-key` header
2. Server validates key via `validateApiKey()`
3. If valid: Process request
4. If invalid: Return 401 Unauthorized
